# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I determined the top 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

# Then I determined the top 10 most energetic songs, which would useful in making a specific playlist like a Gym Playlist
SELECT track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc
LIMIT 10;

# For this query I wanted to see if there was a pattern in the energy, loudness, and tempo of songs by Ariana Grande.
SELECT artist_name,track_name, energy, loudness, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name= 'Ariana Grande'
ORDER BY track_name desc;

# Lastly I wanted to determine the correlation between the danceablity of the top 10 most popular songs.
SELECT track_name, danceability, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;
